							<p>How Can A Cool Blue Virtual Assistant (VA) Save Me Money?
								Giving a task online saves your overhead cost. You won't have to pay for extra space. Don't bother buying a desk or chair. You have no more added costs on electricity and water, too. You save as much as 78% on your operating costs based on a survey. Plus, virtual assistants have all this office stuff in their homes. So, you won't have to buy it for them.</p>
							<p>
								Is The Cost The Same As Keeping A Full-Time Worker?
								You pay only for a specific task and nothing more. A survey estimates a medical assistant's median salary at $35,850 in 2020. It's about $17 to $20 per hour plus benefits or close to double what you would pay a virtual assistant. But unlike a full-time worker, you save even more by not having to pay:
								Taxes
								Worker's compensation
								Health insurance
								Paid vacations and holidays
								Sick leaves.</p>
							<p>How Will They Answer A Phone Call On Behalf Of My Office?
								There are digital phone applications a virtual assistant can download online. It is also called voice-over-internet protocol or VoIP. It gives a virtual assistant a US phone number linked to your office. As a result, it allows them to take real-time calls regardless of their location. They can do receptionist tasks of answering and making calls. At the same time, they can follow up with your patients using the application in accordance with your office policy and procedures seamlessly</p>
